# [GPT2-generated EU legislation](https://thomasdelatte.com/2020/05/eu-text-generator/)

You can generate text yourself [here](https://thomasdelatte.com/gpt2).

You can also run the code in a [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QP-pInYzeYAP2IHJX1JhaPqY062Jd122?usp=sharing).

To the best of my knowledge, GPT-2 had not yet been used to generate texts of a legal nature. 

It might seem odd indeed to want to generate legal texts when legal drafting requires more rigor and method than creativity. I believe nevertheless that it is an adequate way to see if the model stays consistent inside a generated text. 

## Data

EURLEX57K is a database consisting of the 57,000 European Union's Directives, Decisions and Regulations from 1990 to 2019. It is available [here](https://github.com/iliaschalkidis/lmtc-eurlex57k).

To download the data, you can run the "get_data.sh" script.
